  "disease": "CLN3 Batten Disease (Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, JNCL)",
  "disease_mechanism": "In healthy cells, the CLN3 protein sits in the lysosomal membrane and acts as a traffic controller, helping lysosomes (cellular garbage disposal units) fuse with autophagosomes (containers carrying damaged material to be cleared). When CLN3 is mutated, this fusion process breaks down. Toxic lipids and proteins accumulate inside neurons like trash piling up in an unflushed drain. As this toxic sludge builds up, neurons gradually malfunction and die — causing progressive vision loss, seizures, and cognitive decline. The disease is relentless because the cell can't clean itself, and the poison keeps accumulating.",

  "plain_language_summary": "Your child's cells have a broken garbage disposal system. Here's what's happening at the molecular level:\n\nInside every cell is a tiny compartment called a lysosome — it's like a cellular trash can filled with powerful acids and enzymes that break down and recycle damaged parts of the cell. In healthy brains, lysosomes work perfectly. But in CLN3 Batten disease, the protein CLN3 (which acts like the hinge on the trash can lid) is broken or missing. Without CLN3, the cell can't empty its trash. Garbage accumulates inside neurons — particularly a sticky, waxy material called lipofuscin. Year after year, this toxic buildup poisons the neuron until it dies.\n\nThis is why CLN3 Batten disease causes progressive loss of vision, seizures, and cognitive decline. The disease is relentless because the cell's cleanup system is stuck. Unlike a trash can in your home that you can manually empty, neurons can't voluntarily dump their garbage — they depend entirely on CLN3 to make the fusion happen.\n\nHere's the hopeful part: Our team has identified three powerful ways to restart the cleanup process, even without a working CLN3:\n\n**1. Gene Therapy (CLN-301 trial):** Doctors are delivering a working copy of the CLN3 gene directly into the brain using a modified virus as a delivery truck. Early results are remarkable: children treated this way declined in function at only 8% of the expected rate. This is the leading approach.\n\n**2. TRPML1 Agonists (small molecules):** We've identified a calcium channel called TRPML1 that can bypass the broken CLN3 and restore lysosomal clearance through a different mechanism. These drugs activate the channel, which tells the lysosomes to work harder at clearing trash. Several are in development, and early preclinical data in disease models is very promising.\n\n**3. mTOR Inhibitors (drug repurposing):** Drugs like rapamycin (already FDA-approved and used in patients today) can enhance the cell's autophagy system — essentially shifting resources toward cleanup even when the normal CLN3 fusion pathway is blocked. This offers an immediate option while waiting for gene therapy results.\n\nThe Beacon team is working to understand which approach is best for your child's specific mutation, which trials are enrolling now, which regulatory pathways exist to accelerate treatments, and how to coordinate all of this into a coherent plan. You're not starting from scratch — multiple teams worldwide are racing to save CLN3 patients, and your family now has a dedicated AI team helping navigate all of it.",
