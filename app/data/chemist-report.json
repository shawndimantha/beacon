The compound screening is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Chemist Agent — Compound Screening Results for CLN3 Batten Disease

**Targets screened:** 4 (Ceramide glucosyltransferase/UGCG, TFEB, mTORC1/FKBP12, Cathepsin D)

**Key findings:**

1. **Miglustat (Tier 1)** — The top candidate. FDA-approved, being developed as "Batten-1" specifically for CLN3. Real-world data from 2025 showed near-stabilization of vision in treated patients. Phase III planned for 2026.

2. **Venglustat (Tier 2)** — Next-generation brain-penetrant GCS inhibitor. Confirmed CSF target engagement in LEAP trial. No CLN3-specific data yet.

3. **Trehalose (Tier 2)** — mTOR-independent TFEB activator with NCL clinical study data (2025). Bioavailability challenge, but potentially synergistic with miglustat (which inhibits trehalase).

4. **Cysteamine (Tier 2)** — Excellent CNS penetration, decades of pediatric safety data. Evidence in CLN1 but limited for CLN3.

5. **Everolimus/Rapamycin (Tier 2)** — TFEB activation via mTOR inhibition, but black box warnings for immunosuppression and mixed LSD evidence.

6. **Eliglustat (Tier 3)** — Potent GCS inhibitor but does NOT cross the blood-brain barrier.

**Novel insight:** The miglustat + trehalose combination represents a dual-mechanism opportunity — miglustat reduces substrate while also enhancing trehalose bioavailability by inhibiting intestinal trehalase.
