Your work on the DEM-CHILD natural history database represents the most comprehensive understanding of disease progression globally, and we're writing because we want to ensure this family has access to both the natural history context and emerging therapeutic approaches.\n\nWe've identified three active programs in the US: the CLN-301 gene therapy trial at Nationwide Children's (Alcyone Therapeutics), PLX-200 Phase 3 (Polaryx, enrolling March 2026), and Batten-1 (Biocodex, Phase III planned for 2026). Given your expertise in long-term outcomes across CLN3 patients internationally, we're hoping you might advise on:\n\n1. What natural history patterns from DEM-CHILD should inform this family's treatment timing and pathway selection?\n2. Are there CLN3-specific neuropsychological or functional biomarkers that could help stratify which patients may benefit most from each approach?\n3. Do you have recommendations for specialists in the US who should be part of this patient's care team?\n\nThe family has asked us to move quickly but thoughtfully. Would you be open to a brief conversation, or could you suggest the best way to connect them with your team?\n\nThank you for your pioneering work on behalf of CLN3 patients worldwide.\n\nBest regards,\nBeacon Team"

CLN3 is fundamentally a lysosomal storage disorder, and we're curious:\n\n1. Are there cell therapy approaches in development for CLN3 specifically, or could existing intrathecal delivery platforms be repurposed?\n2.
