This family is seeking immediate support to navigate the clinical, regulatory, and research landscape while their child is still in the early stages of the disease.\n\nWHY THIS FAMILY MATTERS:\nThis patient is currently at a critical decision point. With multiple active CLN3 treatment programs now available (CLN-301 gene therapy, PLX-200 small molecule Phase 3 starting March 2026, and Batten-1 Phase III planned for 2026), the family faces complex choices about trial enrollment sequencing, genetic counseling, and baseline clinical evaluation\u2014all time-sensitive given CLN3's relentless progression.\n\nTHE REQUEST:\nWe are seeking $15,000-$25,000 in support to cover:\n1. Clinical baseline evaluation and UBDRS assessment (University of Rochester: $2,000-$3,000)\n2. Genetic counseling and sequencing confirmation ($1,500-$2,000)\n3. Travel to NIH Clinical Center for natural history study enrollment (Bethesda, MD: $3,000-$4,000)\n4. Neuropsychological assessment ($2,000-$3,000)\n5. Family peer support and advocacy coordination ($2,000-$3,000)\n6. Research navigation and trial preparation ($2,000-$3,000)\n7. Contingency for unexpected clinical needs ($2,000-$3,000)\n\nWHY BEYOND BATTEN:\nYour foundation has demonstrated unprecedented success: funding Batten-1 from concept to \u20ac173M pharma licensing, connecting hundreds of families to trials, and building a research infrastructure that spans three continents. This family has identified your organization as the most credible, experienced partner to help them navigate the next critical 12 months.\n\nOUR TEAM:\nBeacon is coordinating a multi-disciplinary team including research scientists, medical liaisons, regulatory strategists, and fundraising coordinators specifically to support this family's treatment pathway. We have direct relationships with trial sponsors (Alcyone, Polaryx) and clinical sites (University of Rochester, Nationwide Children's Hospital, NIH Clinical Center). This family will not be alone.\n\nIMPACT:\nThis grant will enable rapid clinical baseline establishment, informed trial enrollment, and connection to the global CLN3 research community. It also positions this family to participate in future research initiatives and potentially contribute to the natural history data that all CLN3 programs depend on.\n\nWe believe this is precisely the kind of family-facing support that BBDF excels at providing\u2014removing barriers to access, connecting families to the right researchers and trials, and amplifying their voice in the research community.\n\nThank you for considering this request. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this family's needs in more detail.\n\nBest regards,\nBeacon Team",

Multiple active trials exist, but coordination across research sites, trial sponsors, and medical teams is ad-hoc. Families often miss enrollment windows or make uninformed treatment sequence decisions.\n\nSOLUTION:\nBeacon is a coordinated care platform that connects CLN3 families directly to:\n- Active clinical trials and their enrollment criteria\n- Leading researchers and clinicians (NIH, University of Rochester, Nationwide Children's Hospital)\n- Trial sponsor pipelines (Alcyone, Polaryx, Biocodex)\n- Peer families and advocacy organizations\n- Regulatory and fundraising guidance\n\nINNOVATION:\nUnlike traditional patient registries, Beacon combines research discovery, clinical coordination, trial matching, and fundraising strategy in a single, family-facing platform. We use AI agents to continuously monitor the CLN3 research landscape and proactively surface opportunities aligned with each family's treatment pathway.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n1. Enroll 50 CLN3 families in Year 1\n2. Achieve 80% enrollment rate in one of three major clinical trials (CLN-301, PLX-200, Batten-1)\n3. Reduce time-to-baseline-evaluation from 6 months to 6 weeks\n4. Connect 100% of enrolled families to peer support networks\n5. Generate naturalistic outcomes data feeding back into trial design\n\nBUDGET: $150,000 over 18 months\n- Platform development & maintenance: $60,000\n- Research liaison salaries (part-time clinical coordinators): $50,000\n- Peer support & advocacy coordination: $25,000\n- External partnerships (University of Rochester, NIH, Beyond Batten): $15,000\n\nCZI ALIGNMENT:\nThis project directly aligns with Rare As One Network's mission to connect rare disease families, amplify their voice in research, and accelerate translational pathways. CLN3 is an ideal proof-of-concept: well-defined patient population, active trial ecosystem, and motivated families ready to participate.",

This gap creates uncertainty for families, trial design, and regulatory evaluation.\n\nSPECIFIC AIMS:\n1. Establish a prospective natural history cohort of 50 untreated and early-treated CLN3 patients (ages 3-25) with comprehensive biomarking (UBDRS, retinal imaging, CSF, plasma, genetic)\n2. Identify biomarkers predictive of treatment response (gene therapy vs. small molecule vs. miglustat)\n3. Develop outcome measure recommendations for future CLN3 trials\n\nMETHODS:\n- Recruit through NIH Clinical Center (NCT03307304 expansion), University of Rochester, and Nationwide Children's Hospital\n- Annual assessments for 3 years: clinical (UBDRS, AFM, vision), imaging (OCT, MRI), biofluid sampling (CSF, plasma, urine)\n- Genomic and transcriptomic profiling of CLN3 variants\n- Biostatistical modeling of biomarker-outcome relationships\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE:\nCLN3 Batten Disease has NO approved treatments and median survival 24-30 years post-diagnosis. Emerging therapies offer hope but require evidence to guide family decisions and trial design. This natural history cohort will be the reference standard for CLN3 precision medicine.\n\nBUDGET: $350,000 over 3 years\n- Personnel (clinical coordinator, biostatistician, research nurse): $200,000\n- Biomarker assays (genomics, proteomics, imaging): $100,000\n- Patient recruitment and travel support: $30,000\n- Data management and dissemination: $20,000\n\nNIH ALIGNMENT:\nNINDS mission includes rare neurological diseases and precision medicine.

As we navigate treatment pathways, we want to contribute meaningfully to accelerating CLN3 research.\n\nWe've been in dialogue with clinical researchers at [Nationwide Children's / University of Rochester] who have identified a critical gap: the upcoming Biocodex Phase 3 trial will lack standardized biomarkers for patient stratification, likely resulting in larger sample sizes and longer timelines to approval. This directly delays access for all CLN3 families.\n\nWe would like to propose a collaborative 2-year research partnership with BBDF to:\n\n1. Discover plasma/CSF biomarkers predictive of miglustat response using existing patient cohorts\n2. Develop a machine-learning algorithm for patient stratification\n3. Support FDA regulatory interactions for biomarker-companion diagnostic pathway\n\nEstimated investment: $350,000 over 24 months. We are exploring funding through NIH, CZI, and private donors, and would welcome discussion about BBDF's potential partnership role.\n\nThis initiative would:\n- Accelerate Batten-1 approval timeline by 6-12 months\n- Position BBDF as the research catalyst enabling the first CLN3 approved therapy\n- Generate real-world evidence and patient data owned by the community\n- Create decision-support tools for families evaluating treatment options\n\nWe believe this partnership embodies BBDF's mission: translating hope into action.
