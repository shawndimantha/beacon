As we navigate treatment pathways, we want to contribute meaningfully to accelerating CLN3 research.\n\nWe've been in dialogue with clinical researchers at [Nationwide Children's / University of Rochester] who have identified a critical gap: the upcoming Biocodex Phase 3 trial will lack standardized biomarkers for patient stratification, likely resulting in larger sample sizes and longer timelines to approval. This directly delays access for all CLN3 families.\n\nWe would like to propose a collaborative 2-year research partnership with BBDF to:\n\n1.
