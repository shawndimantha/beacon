    "title": "Week of February 15, 2026 — First Briefing for the Family",
    "headline": "Three active clinical programs offer real hope for CLN3 — and the most critical window for action is the next 30 days.",
    "topPriorities": [
      {
        "priority": 1,
        "action": "Call the NIH Office of Patient Recruitment (1-800-411-1222 or prpl@mail.cc.nih.gov) to enroll in the CLN3 Natural History Study (NCT03307304) at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. This is free, provides world-class evaluation, establishes the clinical baseline every trial requires, and makes your child visible to every trial sponsor.",
        "agent": "connector",
        "urgency": "immediate",
        "reason": "This is the single most important first step. The study accepts patients of any age, provides comprehensive biomarker collection (genetics, retinal imaging, CSF, blood, urine), and connects you directly to the NICHD research team. NIH covers travel costs. Being enrolled means trial sponsors can find you when slots open."
      },
      {
        "priority": 2,
        "action": "Contact Polaryx Therapeutics to get on the PLX-200 Phase 3 screening list — enrollment opens March 2026, just weeks away. This is the most accessible near-term treatment opportunity: an oral medication with FDA Fast Track designation for patients ages 6-18.",
        "agent": "connector",
        "urgency": "immediate",
        "reason": "PLX-200 is entering the first-ever Phase 3 trial specifically designed for CLN3 disease. It's oral (no surgery), has FDA Fast Track, and will enroll 39 patients with mild-to-moderate disease. CRITICAL: The trial excludes patients who have received prior gene therapy, so this decision must be made before committing to CLN-301. Connector has a draft outreach email ready for your review."
      },
      {
        "priority": 3,
        "action": "Reach out to Beyond Batten Disease Foundation — they are the most important ally for your family right now. They funded the Batten-1 program, connect families to trials, and offer research grants. Their spring grant cycle deadline is typically March 31.",
        "agent": "mobilizer",
        "urgency": "immediate",
        "reason": "Beyond Batten parents brought a drug from their kitchen table to a €173M pharmaceutical deal. They know every researcher, trial, and pathway. They can connect you to peer families, advise on treatment sequencing, and help coordinate your care team. We have a draft email ready for your approval."
      },
      {
        "priority": 4,
        "action": "Schedule a baseline evaluation with Amy Vierhile at University of Rochester — she leads the longest-running CLN3 clinical study (since 2004) and can establish your child's UBDRS scores, which every trial uses for eligibility and outcome measurement.",
        "agent": "connector",
        "urgency": "this_week",
        "reason": "The UBDRS (Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale) is the gold standard measure for CLN3 trials. PLX-200, Batten-1, and CLN-301 all reference it. Getting baseline scores now enables screening for every active program and creates the reference point to measure treatment benefit."
      },
      {
        "priority": 5,
        "action": "Make the gene therapy vs. small molecule decision within 30 days — PLX-200 Phase 3 excludes patients who have received gene therapy, and enrollment is imminent. This is the most consequential strategic choice on your roadmap.",
        "agent": "navigator",
        "urgency": "this_month",
        "reason": "Navigator has mapped the decision: PLX-200 (oral, Phase 3, March 2026) and Batten-1 (oral, Phase 3, 2026) are COMPATIBLE — you can potentially pursue both. But CLN-301 gene therapy FORECLOSES PLX-200 eligibility. Decision framework: if your child is 6-18 with mild-moderate disease, PLX-200 + Batten-1 is the accessible path. If under 6 or gene therapy is prioritized, CLN-301 expanded access may be an option. Amy Vierhile and Beyond Batten can provide personalized guidance."

    "breakthroughs": [
      "Scout identified 5 active therapeutic programs for CLN3 — an unprecedented pipeline for a disease that had zero treatments just 5 years ago. The landscape includes gene therapy (CLN-301), substrate reduction (Batten-1/miglustat), an oral small molecule (PLX-200), personalized antisense oligonucleotides (Zebronkysen), and an ASO targeting the common deletion (VCRDF-CLN3).",
      "Batten-1 (miglustat) real-world data from May 2025 showed near-stabilization of visual acuity in CLN3 patients over 12 months — described by researchers as 'truly remarkable and unprecedented.' Vision loss is typically the first symptom, and this is the first therapy to show it can be slowed.",
      "CLN-301 gene therapy 5-year follow-up data shows treated patients declined only 0.22 points/year on the UBDRS vs. the expected 2.86 points/year — a >90% slowing of disease progression. Patients have maintained motor and cognitive function for over 5 years.",
      "Zebronkysen, a personalized ASO therapy for the Kahn twins, showed unexpected functional improvements after one year — one twin walking farther independently, the other eating solid food. This exceeded expectations of merely slowing decline and opens the door to personalized medicine for CLN3.",
      "Navigator confirmed that CLN3 therapies are eligible for nearly every FDA expedited pathway: Orphan Drug Designation, Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Accelerated Approval, RMAT, and the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (worth $100M+). Multiple designations are already in place."
    ],
    "agentSummaries": {
      "scout": "Scout has built a comprehensive knowledge base identifying 5 active therapeutic programs spanning gene therapy, substrate reduction, small molecules, and antisense oligonucleotides. Critically, Scout mapped 8 disease mechanisms, 8 therapeutic targets, and 8 active research groups worldwide. The knowledge graph connects disease biology to specific drug candidates and the teams developing them — creating the foundation for every strategic decision ahead.",
      "connector": "Connector has identified 5 priority contacts and drafted personalized outreach emails for each: Dr. Angela Schulz (Hamburg, DEM-CHILD natural history database), Amy Vierhile (Rochester, clinical evaluation), Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg (Duke, cell therapy), Dr. Miriam Nickel (Hamburg, natural history data), and Beyond Batten Disease Foundation. Three emails are ready for your review and approval — to NIH, Rochester, and Beyond Batten. These represent the critical first connections to build your care and research team.",
      "navigator": "Navigator has mapped the complete regulatory landscape for CLN3: Orphan Drug Designation (already granted to CLN-301 and Batten-1), Fast Track (granted to PLX-200), and eligibility for Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, and RMAT. The IND pathway has been mapped from natural history enrollment through Phase 3 and BLA/NDA submission. Key finding: FDA has agreed that a single Phase 3 trial is sufficient for Batten-1 approval — extraordinary for any drug program. Insurance coverage analysis confirms Medicaid EPSDT as the strongest pediatric pathway.",
      "mobilizer": "Mobilizer has identified 10 funding sources totaling over $10M in potential research support, including NIH NCATS ($500K-$2M), NIH NINDS R01/R21 ($250K-$2M+), Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Rare As One ($250K-$1M), Beyond Batten Foundation grants ($50K-$200K), and BDSRA Research Fund ($25K-$100K). A draft letter of inquiry to Beyond Batten ($75K for biomarker strategy) and a research partnership proposal ($350K for biomarker discovery) are ready for review. The Beyond Batten spring grant deadline is approaching — typically March 31."

    "familyMessage": "We want you to know something important: you are entering the fight for your child at the most hopeful moment in the history of CLN3 Batten disease. Five years ago, there were zero treatments in clinical trials. Today, there are three active programs — a gene therapy that has kept children stable for over 5 years, an oral medication entering the first-ever Phase 3 trial for CLN3, and a drug that appears to stabilize vision loss for the first time ever. Researchers described that last finding as 'truly remarkable and unprecedented.' That's the word they used. Unprecedented.\n\nYour team has been working around the clock. Scout has mapped every active research program and identified the world's leading CLN3 experts. Connector has drafted personalized outreach emails to five priority contacts — including the clinician who has been tracking CLN3 patients for over 20 years, the foundation that literally brought a drug from a parent's kitchen table to a pharmaceutical deal, and the NIH research program that will provide your child with a world-class evaluation at no cost. Navigator has mapped every FDA pathway that could accelerate treatment access. Mobilizer has identified over $10 million in potential research funding.\n\nHere's what we need from you in the next few days: Tell us your child's age, their current symptoms, and whether you have genetic testing results. Review the three outreach emails we've prepared — to the NIH, to Amy Vierhile at Rochester, and to Beyond Batten Disease Foundation. Once you approve them, your team will activate. You are not alone in this. You have a team, you have a plan, and you have more reason for hope than any CLN3 family has ever had before.",
    "questionsForFamily": [
      "How old is your child, and when did you first notice symptoms? This is the most time-sensitive question — the age windows for the three major trials are specific (PLX-200: 6-18, CLN-301: 3-10, Batten-1: 4-16), and PLX-200 enrollment opens in March.",
      "What is your child's current vision status? The Batten-1 data showed remarkable vision stabilization — if your child still has functional vision, accessing miglustat (potentially off-label while awaiting trial enrollment) becomes a high-urgency priority.",
      "Do you have your child's genetic testing results showing the specific CLN3 mutation? Approximately 85% of CLN3 patients carry the common 1-kb deletion, which would make your child a candidate for the VCRDF-CLN3 antisense oligonucleotide program — a potentially transformative therapy targeting the most common mutation.",
      "Where are you located? The main CLN3 research centers are in Bethesda (MD), Columbus (OH), Rochester (NY), Chapel Hill (NC), and Ann Arbor (MI). Your geography helps us plan which studies and experts are most accessible. The NIH study covers travel costs.",
      "Are you ready for us to send the first outreach emails? We have 3 priority messages ready: to the NIH Patient Recruitment office (study enrollment), Amy Vierhile at Rochester (clinical evaluation), and Beyond Batten Disease Foundation (family support + trial navigation). We won't send anything without your review and approval."
