In our research, your foundation emerges as the most trusted voice in the CLN3 community\u2014not only because of your direct family support, but because of your extraordinary achievement in bringing Batten-1 to the clinical stage.\n\nWe need guidance on several fronts:\n\n1. **Immediate Clinical Pathway**: We're evaluating CLN-301 (gene therapy), PLX-200 (oral small molecule), and Batten-1 (miglustat). How do you recommend we sequence these options given our child's current disease stage?\n\n2. **Trial Coordination**: Which trials are most accessible right now for our geographic location [state]? How do we prioritize enrollment?\n\n3. **Family Network**: We would benefit enormously from connecting with other CLN3 families who have navigated these same decisions.\n\n4. **Research Partnership**: We understand your foundation funds research and provides grant opportunities. Are there ways we could support or participate in ongoing research initiatives?\n\nWould it be possible to schedule a call with someone on your family support team?\n\nThank you for all you do.\n\nBest regards,\n[Family Name]"
