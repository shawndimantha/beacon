I've been following your work closely and wanted to reach out.\n\nYour group's exon-skipping approach for the common 1kb deletion is extraordinary — the fact that a single neonatal ASO treatment in mice produced robust exon skipping lasting over a year, with improved motor coordination and reduced brain pathology, gives families like ours real hope. And the news about Amelia and Makenzie Kahn's improvements on Zebronkysen — Makenzie walking farther, Amelia eating solid food — that's the kind of thing that keeps us going on the hardest days.\n\nYour recent paper in Nucleic Acids Research showing ASO efficacy in the pig retinal model was particularly meaningful to us, since Emma's vision is one of our deepest concerns. The translation from mouse to large animal feels like a critical step.\n\nI have a specific question: Emma carries [pending genetic confirmation of specific mutation]. As Project Four Leaf Clover advances VCRDF-CLN3 toward the clinic, is there anything families can do now to support or participate in the pathway — whether enrolling in natural history studies, contributing to the biorepository, or connecting with the Vanguard Foundation's efforts?\n\nWe understand you receive many messages, and we're deeply grateful for the work you and your team are doing. It matters more than you know.\n\nWith hope and respect,\n[Emma's parent]"
