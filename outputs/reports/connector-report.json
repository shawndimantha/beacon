  "summary": "**Outreach Strategy - CLN3 Batten Disease (Iteration 0)**\n\nIdentified and drafted emails for 5 critical contacts spanning clinical evaluation, gene therapy, small-molecule therapy, advocacy, and trial enrollment:\n\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This Week):**\n1. **Amy Vierhile at University of Rochester** — Schedule baseline UBDRS evaluation. Gold standard clinical assessment referenced by all trial sponsors.\n2. **NIH Clinical Center (Office of Patient Recruitment)** — Enroll in CLN3 Natural History Study. Free travel, comprehensive biomarkers, direct connection to all researchers.\n\n**HIGH-PRIORITY ACTIONS (Within 2 Weeks):**\n3. **Nationwide Children's Hospital CLN-301 Team** — Express interest in gene therapy trial. Not currently recruiting, but essential to be on priority list if reopens.\n4. **Polaryx Therapeutics (PLX-200)** — Most accessible near-term therapy. Phase 3 enrollment opens March 2026 (weeks away). Oral formulation.\n5. **Beyond Batten Disease Foundation** — The family's most important ally. Provides trial coordination, family network, grant access, treatment pathway guidance.\n\n**CLINICAL DECISION FRAMEWORK:**\nFamily must decide between three pathways:\n- **Gene therapy (CLN-301)**: One-time intrathecal injection; remarkable efficacy (>90% slowing of progression) but not currently recruiting\n- **Small molecule (PLX-200)**: Oral, convenient, enrolling March 2026; good efficacy profile\n- **Small molecule + stabilization (Batten-1/miglustat)**: Vision preservation focus; real-world data shows near-stabilization of visual decline\n\n**RECOMMENDATION FOR NEXT ITERATION:**\nAfter family approves initial outreach emails: Await responses from (1) NIH and (2) Polaryx. Based on responses, identify specific trial sites nearest family's location and coordinate enrollment screening. Connect with Beyond Batten for family network and treatment sequencing guidance."
