      "content": "Dear Beyond Batten Disease Foundation Review Committee,\n\nWe are writing on behalf of a family in the United States who received a recent CLN3 Batten Disease diagnosis. This family is seeking immediate support to navigate the clinical, regulatory, and research landscape while their child is still in the early stages of the disease.\n\nWHY THIS FAMILY MATTERS:\nThis patient is currently at a critical decision point. With multiple active CLN3 treatment programs now available (CLN-301 gene therapy, PLX-200 small molecule Phase 3 starting March 2026, and Batten-1 Phase III planned for 2026), the family faces complex choices about trial enrollment sequencing, genetic counseling, and baseline clinical evaluation—all time-sensitive given CLN3's relentless progression.\n\nTHE REQUEST:\nWe are seeking $15,000-$25,000 in support to cover:\n1. Clinical baseline evaluation and UBDRS assessment (University of Rochester: $2,000-$3,000)\n2. Genetic counseling and sequencing confirmation ($1,500-$2,000)\n3. Travel to NIH Clinical Center for natural history study enrollment (Bethesda, MD: $3,000-$4,000)\n4. Neuropsychological assessment ($2,000-$3,000)\n5. Family peer support and advocacy coordination ($2,000-$3,000)\n6. Research navigation and trial preparation ($2,000-$3,000)\n7. Contingency for unexpected clinical needs ($2,000-$3,000)\n\nWHY BEYOND BATTEN:\nYour foundation has demonstrated unprecedented success: funding Batten-1 from concept to €173M pharma licensing, connecting hundreds of families to trials, and building a research infrastructure that spans three continents. This family has identified your organization as the most credible, experienced partner to help them navigate the next critical 12 months.\n\nOUR TEAM:\nBeacon is coordinating a multi-disciplinary team including research scientists, medical liaisons, regulatory strategists, and fundraising coordinators specifically to support this family's treatment pathway. We have direct relationships with trial sponsors (Alcyone, Polaryx) and clinical sites (University of Rochester, Nationwide Children's Hospital, NIH Clinical Center). This family will not be alone.\n\nIMPACT:\nThis grant will enable rapid clinical baseline establishment, informed trial enrollment, and connection to the global CLN3 research community. It also positions this family to participate in future research initiatives and potentially contribute to the natural history data that all CLN3 programs depend on.\n\nWe believe this is precisely the kind of family-facing support that BBDF excels at providing—removing barriers to access, connecting families to the right researchers and trials, and amplifying their voice in the research community.\n\nThank you for considering this request. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this family's needs in more detail.\n\nBest regards,\nBeacon Team",

      "content": "PROJECT TITLE: CLN3 Family Navigation & Clinical Coordination Platform\n\nCHALLENGE:\nCLN3 Batten Disease families face fragmented, overwhelming information landscape. Multiple active trials exist, but coordination across research sites, trial sponsors, and medical teams is ad-hoc. Families often miss enrollment windows or make uninformed treatment sequence decisions.\n\nSOLUTION:\nBeacon is a coordinated care platform that connects CLN3 families directly to:\n- Active clinical trials and their enrollment criteria\n- Leading researchers and clinicians (NIH, University of Rochester, Nationwide Children's Hospital)\n- Trial sponsor pipelines (Alcyone, Polaryx, Biocodex)\n- Peer families and advocacy organizations\n- Regulatory and fundraising guidance\n\nINNOVATION:\nUnlike traditional patient registries, Beacon combines research discovery, clinical coordination, trial matching, and fundraising strategy in a single, family-facing platform. We use AI agents to continuously monitor the CLN3 research landscape and proactively surface opportunities aligned with each family's treatment pathway.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n1. Enroll 50 CLN3 families in Year 1\n2. Achieve 80% enrollment rate in one of three major clinical trials (CLN-301, PLX-200, Batten-1)\n3. Reduce time-to-baseline-evaluation from 6 months to 6 weeks\n4. Connect 100% of enrolled families to peer support networks\n5. Generate naturalistic outcomes data feeding back into trial design\n\nBUDGET: $150,000 over 18 months\n- Platform development & maintenance: $60,000\n- Research liaison salaries (part-time clinical coordinators): $50,000\n- Peer support & advocacy coordination: $25,000\n- External partnerships (University of Rochester, NIH, Beyond Batten): $15,000\n\nCZI ALIGNMENT:\nThis project directly aligns with Rare As One Network's mission to connect rare disease families, amplify their voice in research, and accelerate translational pathways. CLN3 is an ideal proof-of-concept: well-defined patient population, active trial ecosystem, and motivated families ready to participate.",

      "content": "PROJECT TITLE: CLN3 Natural History Phenotyping & Biomarker Discovery in the Era of Emerging Therapeutics\n\nRATIONALE:\nThree CLN3 therapeutics have advanced to Phase III trials (2025-2026), but no standardized natural history cohort exists to compare treatment efficacy across programs. This gap creates uncertainty for families, trial design, and regulatory evaluation.\n\nSPECIFIC AIMS:\n1. Establish a prospective natural history cohort of 50 untreated and early-treated CLN3 patients (ages 3-25) with comprehensive biomarking (UBDRS, retinal imaging, CSF, plasma, genetic)\n2. Identify biomarkers predictive of treatment response (gene therapy vs. small molecule vs. miglustat)\n3. Develop outcome measure recommendations for future CLN3 trials\n\nMETHODS:\n- Recruit through NIH Clinical Center (NCT03307304 expansion), University of Rochester, and Nationwide Children's Hospital\n- Annual assessments for 3 years: clinical (UBDRS, AFM, vision), imaging (OCT, MRI), biofluid sampling (CSF, plasma, urine)\n- Genomic and transcriptomic profiling of CLN3 variants\n- Biostatistical modeling of biomarker-outcome relationships\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE:\nCLN3 Batten Disease has NO approved treatments and median survival 24-30 years post-diagnosis. Emerging therapies offer hope but require evidence to guide family decisions and trial design. This natural history cohort will be the reference standard for CLN3 precision medicine.\n\nBUDGET: $350,000 over 3 years\n- Personnel (clinical coordinator, biostatistician, research nurse): $200,000\n- Biomarker assays (genomics, proteomics, imaging): $100,000\n- Patient recruitment and travel support: $30,000\n- Data management and dissemination: $20,000\n\nNIH ALIGNMENT:\nNINDS mission includes rare neurological diseases and precision medicine. NCATS supports biomarker-driven clinical trial design. NICHD funds pediatric rare disease research. This proposal bridges all three institutes.",

For CLN3, a dedicated 501(c)(3) enables: (1) Independent grant funding and fundraising; (2) Ownership of patient registry and natural history data; (3) Negotiating power with pharma partners; (4) Long-term sustainability beyond a single trial or therapy. Beyond Batten Disease Foundation is the model: founded by parents, now funds €173M pharma partnerships and leads global CLN3 advocacy. Fiscal sponsorship is simpler initially but creates dependency on umbrella organization and limits governance autonomy. For rare disease families aspiring to influence drug development, 501(c)(3) is the right choice.",

  "plainLanguageSummary": "CLN3 Batten Disease families have never had a better funding landscape. Three active pharmaceutical programs—a gene therapy from Alcyone, an oral small-molecule from Polaryx, and miglustat (Batten-1) from Biocodex—are all advancing to or into Phase 3 trials in 2026. This convergence creates unique opportunities for this family to access cutting-edge treatment while becoming a research partner.\n\nImmediately, your family should apply to Beyond Batten Disease Foundation's Spring Grant Cycle (deadline March 31, 2026) for $15K-$25K in support. They've funded everything from Batten-1 to clinical trial navigation; they understand rare disease families intimately and move quickly. Simultaneously, launch a family fundraising campaign ($10K-$30K goal) to cover baseline clinical evaluation, genetic counseling, and travel to NIH Clinical Center for natural history study enrollment. This combination typically provides $40K-$50K—enough to get your child clinically established within 3 months.\n\nMedium-term (months 3-9), you'll apply for larger grants from NIH, CZI, and academic partnerships. Most of these grants require you to be working with academic medical centers (University of Rochester, Nationwide Children's Hospital, NIH Clinical Center), so your early clinical enrollment establishes the relationships needed. This tier generates $150K-$300K for expanded biomarker research, advanced imaging, and trial coordination.\n\nLong-term (months 9-24+), your family can consider forming a 501(c)(3) research foundation. Beyond Batten Disease Foundation is the model—parent-founded organization that now partners with pharma, advises on regulatory strategy, and funds research infrastructure. This requires pro-bono legal support ($3K-$5K) and board governance, but gives you direct control over research priorities and funding allocation. Venture philanthropy funds (Harrington Discovery Institute, FasterCures, Venture Philanthropy Partners) explicitly invest in rare disease foundations at this stage; you could raise $500K-$2M+ to establish long-term research infrastructure.\n\nMost importantly: every grant and partnership should be sequenced around trial enrollment windows. PLX-200 enrolls March 2026 (oral medication, 39 patients needed). Batten-1 Phase 3 launches late 2026 (near-stabilization of vision in early data). CLN-301 gene therapy (Alcyone) continues indefinitely but enrolls slowly. Your family should understand the trade-offs: gene therapy is most powerful but permanent, small molecule is more flexible if outcomes are modest, miglustat is bridge therapy while deciding. Beyond Batten Disease Foundation can mentor this decision. We've drafted initial grant applications for your review and approval—these are compelling, specific to your situation, and ready to submit within days."
